# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

**Marketing Campaign Analysis**

**Overview**

This project utilises Python to conduct detailed data analysis on an e-commerce company's marketing activities. Categories and campaigns are dissected to unearth new insights on the most effective marketing strategies. Insightful visualisations are included to enhance user understanding of these distinct categories and campaigns. Classic marketing metrics e.g ROI, ROAS and CPL are calculated and compared throughout.
